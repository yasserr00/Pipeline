# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., `ml-pipeline` or `mlops-housing-prediction`)
5. Choose visibility (Public or Private)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME with your actual values)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Or if using SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment File

After cloning the repository, users need to:

1. Copy the example config file:
   ```bash
   cp dev.yml.example dev.yml
   ```

2. Edit `dev.yml` with their own values:
   - Change PostgreSQL password
   - Change Airflow admin password
   - Update any other configuration as needed

## Important Notes

- `dev.yml` is in `.gitignore` and will NOT be committed (contains sensitive passwords)
- `dev.yml.example` is committed as a template
- Never commit actual passwords or API keys to GitHub
- The `mlruns/` directory is also ignored (contains MLflow artifacts)

## What's Included in the Repository

- All source code
- Configuration templates
- Docker setup files
- Documentation (README.md)
- Requirements file
- Scripts for automation

## What's NOT Included (by design)

- `venv/` - Virtual environment (users create their own)
- `mlruns/` - MLflow tracking data (generated locally)
- `data/*.csv` - Data files (users provide their own)
- `dev.yml` - Actual configuration with passwords
- `*.log` - Log files
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
